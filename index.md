This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Telecom sector 

Worked on on-shore engagement in Australia with one of the biggest Australian telecom providers. Design and developed an automation solution to automate their finance process like calculating external /internal commissions for vendors, processing rekey requests  and customer-facing processes like process bereavement requests, raising network outage reports and providing updates to customers for the outage.

## Automobile sector:

Project include automating the BTO (Built-To-Order) retail Sweep and Allocate process serves to identify the unscheduled order from the most recent week in order to properly allocate them to a target scheduling week. The process is meant to adjust allocation on both the dealer and regional levels to account for those orders.
